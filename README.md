1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The stock market is a vast and complex network, and predicting stock prices is one of the most challenging tasks in finance. This research project focuses on forecasting the stock prices of Tata Steel, one of India's leading steel manufacturing companies, using various machine learning models. Our aim is to develop, test, and compare different predictive models to determine the most accurate and reliable approach for stock price prediction.

2. Objective <a name="objective"></a>
Develop a predictive model for forecasting Tata Steel's stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques.
Compare multiple models to identify the most suitable one for this research.
3. Research Question <a name="research-question"></a>
Can historical data be used to develop an accurate predictive model for forecasting the stock prices of Tata Steel using machine learning?
Which machine learning model (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks) provides the most accurate predictions?
4. Data Description <a name="data-description"></a>
Data Source: Historical stock price data for Tata Steel will be obtained from reliable financial databases.
Features: The dataset may include features such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and other relevant financial indicators.
Target Variable: The primary target variable will be the closing price of Tata Steelâ€™s stock.
5. Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>
Data Collection: Gather historical stock price data.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for modeling. This includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
Model Development: Implement various machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Comparison: Compare the models to determine which one performs the best for stock price prediction.
